# fb-pages-webhook

This example shows how to use facebook api to get user pages and subscribe 
to the page events. 

I used 
  - koala gem https://github.com/arsduo/koala
  - facebook-messenger gem https://github.com/hyperoslo/facebook-messenger
  

The example is divided in two parts: 

1. We log the user into our facebook app and get user pages 

2. We use facebook messenger to interact with pages conversations.
